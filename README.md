#WebKiller
=========
##A backdoor scan tool (Written in PHP)

Killing the script based on static matching php-backdoor

Preface:

Killing php-backdoor for webmasters to use virtual hostsdoor, it has been a difficult, predecessors wrote before killing some php script, for example: Cmstop of scanner.php, Spider wrote Spider.php. These scripts use the regular match, obviously, today we have enough of killing webshell.

Why do not you applied?

Rules are written entirely inadequate。

WebKiller added a lot of new features backdoor。
